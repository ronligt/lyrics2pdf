*Verse*
I don't know where I'm going
It's an uncharted sky
I don't think I even really know
What I'm feeling inside
Love is so uncertain
Who can say what's in store
This is deeper, farther, higher
Than I've been before
\
*Chorus*
I'm flying blind
Wherever your love takes me
I'm letting go and I don't care if I fall
I'll close my eyes with you beside me
I follow faith and let it guide me
Tonight I'm leaving all my fears behind
I'm flying blind
\
*Verse*
I won't question tomorrow
It's a mystery to me
I just know what your touch in me does
I know this is where I wanna be
It's a risk worth taking
I don't want to come down
Play my heart
Got my cards on the table
Got my head up in the clouds
\
*Chorus*
I'm flying blind
Wherever your love takes me
I'm letting go and I don't care if I fall
I'll close my eyes with you beside me
I follow faith and let it guide me
Tonight I'm leaving all my fears behind
I'm flying blind
