*Verse*
If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it take just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way

*Chorus*
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be even better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

*Verse*
Why not think about times to come
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do

*Chorus*
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

*Verse*
All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

*Chorus*
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

*Chorus*
Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be, better than before,
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone

Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
Ooh, don't you look back
