*Verse*
I'm sorry for the times that I made you scream
For the times that I killed your dreams
For the times that I made your whole world rumble
For the times that I made you cry
For the times that I told you lies
For the times that I watched and let you stumble
\
*Chorus*
It's too bad, but that's me
What goes around comes around, you'll see
That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time that a man goes insane
And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
I suck out all the love I, I'll never be nobody's wife
\
*Verse*
I'm sorry for the times that I didn't come home
Left you lyin' in that bed alone
Flyin' high in the sky when you needed my shoulder
You're like a stone hangin' round my neck, see
Cut it loose before it breaks my back, see
I've gotta say what I feel before I grow older
I'm sorry but I ain't gonna change my ways
You know I've tried but I'm still the same
I've got to do it my own way
\
*Chorus*
It's too bad, but hey, that's me
What goes around comes around, you'll see
That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time, no, that a man goes insane
And when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
Suck out all the love, I, I'll never be nobody's wife
\
*Chorus*
It's too bad, but hey, that's me
What goes around comes around, you'll see
That I can carry the burden of pain
'Cause it ain't the first time, oh no, that a man goes insane
'Cause when I spread my wings to embrace him for life
Suck out his love, I, I'll never be nobody's wife
\
I'll never be, never be, never gonna be, never gonna be, never gonna be, nobody's wife
